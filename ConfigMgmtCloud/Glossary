

A/B testing: A way to compare two versions of something to find out which version performs better

Automatic scaling: This service uses metrics to automatically increase or decrease the capacity of the system

Disk image: A snapshot of a virtual machine’s disk at a given point in time

Ephemeral storage: Storage used for instances that are temporary and only need to keep local data while they’re running

Hot data: Accessed frequently and stored in hot storage

Hybrid cloud: A mixture of both public and private clouds

Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS): Measures how many reads or writes you can do in one second, no matter how much data you're accessing

Infrastructure as a Service (or IaaS): When a Cloud provider supplies only the bare-bones computing experience

Load balancer: Ensures that each node receives a balanced number of requests

Manual scaling: Changes are controlled by humans instead of software

Multi-cloud: A mixture of public and/or private clouds across vendors

Object storage: Storage where objects are placed and retrieved into a storage bucket

Orchestration: The automated configuration and coordination of complex IT systems and services

Persistent storage: Storage used for instances that are long lived and need to keep data across reboots and upgrades

Platform as a Service (or PaaS): When a Cloud provider offers a preconfigured platform to the customer

Private cloud: When your company owns the services and the rest of your infrastructure

Public cloud: The cloud services provided to you by a third party

Rate limits: Prevent one service from overloading the whole system

Reference images: Store the contents of a machine in a reusable format

Software as a Service (or SaaS): When a Cloud provider delivers an entire application or program to the customer

Sticky sessions: All requests from the same client always go to the same backend server

Templating: The process of capturing all of the system configuration to let us create VMs in a repeatable way

Throughput: The amount of data that you can read and write in a given amount of time

Utilization limits: Cap the total amount of a certain resource that you can provision

Artifact: A byproduct of the software development process that can be accessed and used, an item produced during programming

Container registry: A storage location for container images, organized for efficient access

Container repository: A container registry that manages container images

Docker: An open-source tool used to build, deploy, run, update, and manage containers

Pod: A group of one or more containers that are scheduled and run together 

Registry: A place where containers or artifacts are stored and organized

Kubernetes: An open-source platform that gives programmers the power to orchestrate containers  

Configuration management: Automation technique that manages the configuration of computers at scale

Domain-Specific Language (DSL): A programming language that's more limited in scope

Facts: Variables that represent the characteristics of the system

Puppet: The current industry standard for configuration management, also known as the client

Puppet master: Known as the Puppet server

Continuous delivery: Any changes to the software are tested and then deployed to users and servers as soon as they are verified

Continuous deployment: Automates the deployment of code to production

Continuous integration: Constantly adding updates and improvements to software

DevOps: Describes the steps of the software development lifecycle beyond writing code, the union between the development team and the operations team

DevSecOps: Adding security testing and protection to the software development lifecycle

Production: The software is pushed out to the end users from a cloud server

Staging: A strategic DevOps approach where we specify the build steps and tests
