from rearrange import rearrange_name

This line imports the rearrange_name function from the rearrange module. 
Presumably, this module contains the logic for rearranging names.
import unittest

This line imports the unittest module, which provides a testing framework.
class TestRearrange(unittest.TestCase):

This line defines a test class named TestRearrange that inherits from unittest.
TestCase. Test methods within this class should start with the word "test."
def test_basic(self):

This method defines a test case named test_basic.
It provides an input (testcase) in the format "Lovelace, Ada" and the expected 
output (expected) as "Ada Lovelace."
It uses self.assertEqual to check if the result of rearrange_name(testcase) matches 
the expected output.
def test_empty(self):

Similar to the previous method, this test case handles an empty string input.
def test_double_name(self):

This test case deals with a name containing a middle initial, like "Hopper, Grace M."
def test_one_name(self):

This test case handles a single-name input, like "Voltaire."
unittest.main()

This line runs the tests when the script is executed. It triggers the test discovery
 and execution within the unittest framework.
When you run this script, the unittest framework will execute each test case method 
and report whether the actual results match the expected results. If everything is 
correct, there should be no output. If a test fails, the framework will provide 
information about the failure.
